After successfull installation just call to get all packages

``npm install``

For starting the jsx-watcher to build modified JSX files continuously just call ``npm run jsx-watch``.
A single JSX run you execute with ``npm run jsx``

To create a javscript bundle simply call ``npm run optimize``.
If you want to make a complete deploy you may use the ``.\build.bat`` script (A Bash shell will follow someday).
